# Introduction

YANG modeling language is very popular for node configuration and retrieving the the state of a device.  
XML and JSON are also to popular way to serialize the data model. Recently a new serialization format has
been published, allowing a more compact representation of the information. This new format is based on CBOR
and the YANG identifier instead of been represented by a unique ASCII string, are mapped to an unique integer.

The mapping between strings and integer is kept in a .sid file usually generated by tools such as pyang.

This document presents some extensions to the sid files, to ease the conversion between CBOR and JSON and also 
to manipulate YANG Data Model in a constraint environment. 

# YANG Data model

A YANG is a modeling language to structure the information and check its conformity. Each element of a YANG Data Model
is identified through an unique identifier. YANG is based on a hierarchical approach. During the serialization phase, 
data are represented either in XML or JSON. In this part we will use the JSON representation. {{RFC7951}} indicates how to 
to form a JSON structure conform to a YANG Data Model:

* Leaves are represented as JSON objects, the key being the leaf name.
* Lists are defined through arrays, 
* Identityref is a string containing the hierarchy to
